<h3> Description: </h3>
<p> Many machine learning tasks and computer vision algorithms are susceptible to image/video/audio quality artifacts. Nonetheless, most visual learning and vision systems assume high-quality image/video/audio as input. In reality, noises and distortions are common in image/video/audio capturing and acquisition process. Oftentimes, artifacts can be introduced in the video compression, transcoding, transmission, decoding, and/or rendering process. All of these quality issues play a critical role on the performance of learning algorithms, systems and applications, therefore could directly impact the customer experience.
</p>
        <h3> Topics: </h3>
        <p>This workshop addresses topics related to image/video/audio quality in machine learning, computer vision, and generative AI. The topics include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
                        <li>Impact of image/video/audio quality in traditional machine learning and computer vision use cases such as object detection, segmentation, tracking, and recognition;
                        <li>Analyze, model and learn the quality impact from image/video/audio acquisition, compression, transcoding, transmission, decoding, rendering, and/or display;
                        <li>Techniques used to improve image/video/audio quality in terms of

                        <ul>
                            <li>brightening, color adjustment, sharpening, inpainting, deblurring, denoising, de-hazing, de-raining, demosaicing,
                            <li>removing artifacts such as shadows, glare, and reflections, etc.,
                            <li>resolution, frame rate, color gamut, dynamic range (SDR vs. HDR), etc.,
                            <li>noise/echo cancellation, speech enhancement, etc.;
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Novel image/video/audio quality assessment methodologies: full reference, reduced-reference, and non-reference;
                    <li>Impact of image/video/audio quality in multi-modal use cases;
                    <li>Evaluate image/video/audio quality produced by generative AI;
                    <li>Techniques to detect and mitigate audio/video synchronization issue;
                    <li>Techniques to measure the quality consistency across different types of content in video (such as ads, movies, streamed content, etc.);
                    <li>Datasets, statistics, and theory of image/video/audio quality;
                    <li>Research, applications and system development of the above.

    <section id="Submission">
        <h2>Submission Guidelines and Review Process:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Authors are encouraged to submit high-quality, original (i.e., not been previously published or accepted for publication in substantially similar form in any peer-reviewed venue including journal, conference or workshop) research.
            <li>All submissions should follow the same template as for the main WACV2024 conference. Please refer to the WACV <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YaMHj7d_vmmBrnro-8kRv8CctpEizNIH/view">author kit </a>. 
            <li>The main paper has an 8-page limit, references do not count toward this. There is no limit on the number of pages in the supplementary material. Only pdf files are accepted.
            <li>Unlike the main conference(WACV2024), the review process for this workshop has only one round, and is single-blind. Authors do not have to be anonymized when submitting their work.
            <li>Please submit your paper via this link: <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/WVAQ2024">https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/WVAQ2024</a>
            <li>Authors of accepted papers will be notified via email by: <b>10 November, 2023 </b>
        </ul>

    <section id="Competition">
    <h2>Competition</h2>
    <p>
        Alongside the workshop we are hosting a Grand Challenge on the identification of audiovisual synchronization (AV-Sync) errors.  
        An AV-Sync error, the temporal misalignment of audio relative to the video, is a defect that can have a large impact on a viewer’s Quality of Experience. 
        The Telecommunications Union’s Rec. ITU-T J.248: Requirements for operational monitoring of video-to-audio delay in the distribution of television programs (2008) 
        used subjective experiments to determine participants could detect an AV-Sync error if the audio leads the video by greater than 45 ms and if the audio lags the video by greater than 125 ms.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Grand Challenge will consist of two tasks:
        <ul>
            <li><b> AV-Sync Error Detection </b> - participants will make a binary prediction whether the audio is out-of-sync with the video. 
                For more information please see: <a href="https://www.codabench.org/competitions/1541/"> https://www.codabench.org/competitions/1541/ </a></li>
            <li><b> AV-Sync Error Measurement </b> - participants will predict a quantitative measure of the magnitude of the AV-Sync Error. 
                For more information please see:  <a href="https://www.codabench.org/competitions/1543/"> https://www.codabench.org/competitions/1543/ </a></li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        The two tasks will have a combined prize fund of <b style='color:red;'>$12000</b>. 
        We invite participants to enter one or both of the tasks at the links above with the following timelines:
        <ul>
            <li><b>2023-10-11</b> - Release of the Training Dataset</li>
            <li><b>2023-10-11</b> - Initial Submission Opens</li>
            <li><b>2023-12-02 00:00:00 UTC</b> - Challenge Closes (Final Submissions: 1. to leaderboard and 2. summary report, model and weights)</li>
            <li><b>2023-12-15</b> - Announcement of Awardees</li>
            <li><b>2023-12-22</b> - Workshop Presentation Signup Deadline</li>
